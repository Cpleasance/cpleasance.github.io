## Profile

Data Science and AI student at University of Stirling researching LLM security through linear probes, adversarial testing frameworks, and mechanistic interpretability. Building multi-model adversarial systems to evaluate alignment robustness across LLM architectures. Experienced in ML pipelines, dual-GPU training, and low-level systems programming.

---

## Research

### LLM Security Research Assistant
**University of Stirling** · Supervisor: Dr. Paulius Stankaitis · *Sep 2024 – Present*

- Training linear probes across 32 layers of Qwen and Mistral models to locate safety-critical decision boundaries and identify which layers encode refusal vs. compliance behaviour
- Created adversarial prompt testing framework evaluating alignment robustness across 3+ LLM architectures, systematically cataloguing jailbreak failure modes
- Architecting a multi-model adversarial council using PAIR-style iterative refinement, where 3+ diverse LLM architectures collaboratively generate and improve attacks through cross-model feedback loops
- Engineered dual-GPU (CUDA) activation extraction pipeline in PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, processing high-dimensional activation vectors at scale across multiple architectures
- Co-authoring research paper with Dr. Stankaitis on LLM safety evaluation
