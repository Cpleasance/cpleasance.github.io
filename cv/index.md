## Profile

A BSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student who is passionate about machine learning and data science, with a strong emphasis on research-led projects. My primary focus is on Large Language Models, developing prompting strategies, performing adversarial/jailbreak testing, engineering models for robustness, and evaluating performance. I highly enjoy integrating LLMs into production-grade systems. With a keen interest in High-Performance Computing and distributed training across multi-GPU/CPU/TPU setups. I thrive on intellectually challenging roles that grant autonomy while enabling close collaboration within focused R&D teams, big-tech ML groups, or applied domains such as healthcare and fintech.
