## Profile

Data Science and AI student researching Large Language Model security and mechanistic interpretability at University of Stirling. Working with linear probes and adversarial testing frameworks to evaluate alignment robustness across LLM architectures. Experienced in distributed training, production ML pipelines, and low-level systems programming.

## Research

### LLM Security Research Assistant
**University of Stirling** · Supervisor: Dr. Paulius Stankaitis · *Sep 2024 – Present*

- Training linear probes on Olmo-3-7B-Think layer activations to isolate safety-critical decision boundaries, identifying which transformer layers encode refusal vs. compliance behaviour
- Developed adversarial prompt testing framework that systematically evaluates alignment robustness across multiple LLM architectures, cataloguing failure modes in instruction-following behaviour
- Building cross-model activation simulator that predicts safety-relevant neural patterns from one architecture to another, reducing the cost of per-model safety audits
- Engineered dual-GPU analysis pipeline in PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers for large-scale activation extraction and processing across 32 transformer layers
- Co-authoring research paper on novel approaches to mechanistic interpretability for LLM safety evaluation
