## About

I am a Data Science and AI student at the University of Stirling, dedicated to the security and scalability of Large Language Models.

My research concentrates on adversarial testing and red teaming to enhance model alignment, supported by a strong foundation in High-Performance Computing and distributed training.

Whether I'm writing custom bootloaders in x86 Assembly, optimizing S&P 500 forecasting pipelines, or evaluating LLM robustness, I am driven by complex, research-led challenges.
